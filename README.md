# AzureResourceGroups
A <b>resource group</b> in Azure serves as a logical container for related resources within an Azure solution. They are used for the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>Organization and Management</b>: Resource groups help organize resources, making it easier to manage and coordinate changes. You can group resources based on their lifecycle or purpose.</li>
  <li><b>Cost Management</b> : By grouping resources together, you can manage costs more effectively. For example, you can track expenses for a specific project or department.</li>
  <li><b>Access Control</b>: Resource groups allow you to control access at the group level. You can assign permissions to users or applications for all resources within the group.</li>
  <li><b>Metadata Storage</b>: The resource group stores metadata about the resources it contains. When you specify a location for the group, youâ€™re determining where that metadata is stored.</li>
</ul>

To create a resource group in Azure:
<ol>
  <li>Sign in to the Azure portal.</li>
